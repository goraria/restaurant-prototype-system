# ðŸ”§ RLS SQL Fix Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Non-existent Table Reference**
- **Problem**: SQL referenced `organization_memberships` table which doesn't exist in Prisma schema
- **Fix**: Removed all `organization_memberships` related policies and functions
- **Impact**: Simplified organization access model

### 2. **Incorrect Organization Access Pattern**
- **Problem**: Used membership-based access control (organization_memberships table)
- **Fix**: Changed to owner-based access control using `organizations.owner_id` relationship
- **New Function**: `is_organization_owner()` instead of `is_organization_member()`

### 3. **Invalid Field References**
- **Problem**: Organizations table doesn't have `status` field
- **Fix**: Removed status-based filtering for organizations public access
- **Change**: Made all organizations publicly readable (appropriate for restaurant directory)

### 4. **Incomplete Role Enum Values**
- **Problem**: Admin check only looked for `'admin'` role
- **Fix**: Updated to include both `'admin'` and `'super_admin'` roles
- **Schema**: Matches actual `user_role_enum` values: `customer`, `staff`, `manager`, `admin`, `super_admin`

## Updated Schema Alignment

### Users Table âœ…
- **clerk_id**: `String?` - Clerk Auth ID (nullable, unique)
- **role**: `user_role_enum` - With values: customer, staff, manager, admin, super_admin
- **status**: `user_status_enum` - With values: active, inactive, suspended, banned

### Organizations Table âœ…
- **id**: `String` - UUID primary key
- **owner_id**: `String` - References users.id
- **No status field**: All organizations are publicly viewable
- **No membership table**: Direct owner relationship only

## Policy Structure

### Users Policies
- âœ… `users_select_own` - Users can view their own profile
- âœ… `users_select_admin` - Admins can view all users
- âœ… `users_update_own` - Users can update their own profile
- âœ… `users_update_admin` - Admins can update any user
- âœ… `users_insert_webhook` - Allow webhook insertions
- âœ… `users_delete_own` - Users can delete their own account
- âœ… `users_delete_admin` - Admins can delete any user

### Organizations Policies
- âœ… `organizations_select_public` - Public read access to all organizations
- âœ… `organizations_select_owners` - Owners can view (redundant but explicit)
- âœ… `organizations_select_admin` - Admins can view all
- âœ… `organizations_insert_auth` - Authenticated users can create
- âœ… `organizations_update_owners` - Owners can update their organizations
- âœ… `organizations_update_admin` - Admins can update any organization
- âœ… `organizations_delete_owners` - Owners can delete their organizations
- âœ… `organizations_delete_admin` - Admins can delete any organization

## Testing Functions

### `test_rls_context()`
Returns current user context for debugging:
- Current Clerk ID
- Admin status
- JWT claims

### Verification Queries
- Check RLS enabled status
- List all policies for users and organizations

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Supabase**: Run the corrected SQL file in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Test RLS**: Use the test routes in `/rls/test/*` endpoints
3. **Verify Access**: Check that owners can manage their organizations
4. **Admin Testing**: Verify admin users can access all resources

## File Status
- âœ… **Fixed**: `supabase/rls-simple.sql` - Now matches actual Prisma schema
- âœ… **Compatible**: Works with existing `routes/rlsTestRoutes.ts`
- âœ… **Ready**: For deployment to Supabase database
